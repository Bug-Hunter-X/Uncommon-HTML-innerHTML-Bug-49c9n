# Uncommon HTML Bug: innerHTML Misuse

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur when using `innerHTML` in HTML.  The issue arises when using `innerHTML` on an element that already contains child elements. Replacing the `innerHTML` removes the previous content, and it may be not the desired behavior.

## Bug Description
The provided HTML code snippet uses `innerHTML` to change the content of a div. However, this approach incorrectly removes existing child nodes instead of appending to them.   This might lead to unexpected behavior or data loss.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates the correct way to modify the content of an element, either by appending to existing content or ensuring the complete replacement is intended. Using `insertAdjacentHTML` can provide more fine-grained control over content insertion.
